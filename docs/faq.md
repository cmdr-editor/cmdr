Frequently Asked questions


## #1 - Can I run CMDR on my macOS?

Yes. See [this page](docs/running_on_macos.md).

Options are Azure Cloud, VirtualBox or WineBottler emulation.



## #2 - CMDR.EXE disapears when I unpack the zip file

If the EXE file disapears, this is because your anti-virus quarantined the file. CMDR doesn't have a digital signature yet.\
In this case make an exception for CMDR.exe.

CMDR has a perfect VirusTotal check: [0 out of 72](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ab1db0d627782cfd55867addbac61d55be9debed9c3483ee527733eecf7b6610/detection)
